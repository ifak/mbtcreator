## Running Unit Tests
All Unit Tests in mbtcreator are implemented using [Qt Test framework](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qttest-index.html).
It is recommended to run all units tests using the QtCreator, an IDE developed by Qt:
- [Running Tests in QtCreator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-autotest.html#building-and-running-tests)

Alternatively, it is possible to run the tests by starting the executable generated for each test script or by running *nmake check* in the build directory using a console.
